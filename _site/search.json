This includes transferring data science and computational social science methods to the identification of AI Cyber and Economic Security Threats.\nAt this time, this work often involves `red-teaming’ generative AI models, including for industry partners."

Your (prospective) boss has given you a general or ambiguous job description or task to do. You’d like feedback on how, when (etc.) your (prospective) boss would like the task done. You’re unsure how to compose an email to ask. Describe the job description or task to the ChatBot. Would you send this email to your boss? Yes? No? Why or why not?\n\n\nNote\nWe have found the connection to Voiceflow buggy. If the chatBot doesn’t respond, please start a new chat and try again. If that doesn’t work, wait 10-15 minutes, and it will usually work at some point.\nThis is about the most basic prototype we could make. We are working to add more interaction types and resolve the connection issues and bugs."
