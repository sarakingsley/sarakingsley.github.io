## Current Status:
Seasons greetings Carnegie Mellon community, I am available for meetings Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

## Research & Work:
My research specifically focuses on understanding the economic risks of A.I. systems and tools, including generative A.I. models, for vulnerable, disadvantaged, and marginalized end-users and society.

I study this research topic by modifying existing methods for auditing -- as well as developing novel methods for auditing -- machine learning (or A.I.) systems and models.

At this time, this work often involves `red-teaming' generative A.I. models, including for industry partners.

## Red-teaming Inquiries:
To inquire about my availability to join your company's red-team, please send an email to skingsle@cs.cmu.edu
