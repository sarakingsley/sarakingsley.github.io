## Current Status:
Seasons greetings Carnegie Mellon community, this summer I am available for meetings Mondays and Wednesdays.

## Research & Work:
My research specifically focuses on understanding the economic and cybersecurity risks of Machine Learning (M.L.) or A.I. systems and tools, including generative A.I. models.

I study this research topic by modifying existing methods for auditing -- as well as developing novel methods for evaluating -- machine learning or A.I. systems and models.

At this time, this work often involves `red-teaming' generative A.I. models, including for industry partners.

## Red-teaming Inquiries:
To inquire about my availability to join your organization's red-team, please send an email to skingsle@cs.cmu.edu
