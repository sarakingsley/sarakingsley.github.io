    "text": "Sara Kingsley is a PhD Researcher at Carnegie Mellon University’s School of Computer Science, where she is advised by Dr. Beibei Li and Dr. Jeffrey P. Bigham.\nSara is an expert in designing methods to investigate social media platforms and online labor markets for unlawful and discriminatory practices, having researched Facebook, Google, Twitter, and YouTube. More recently, her dissertation work focuses on studying how the design of algorithms and digital platforms impacts how marginalized groups and low-income job seekers find economic opportunities.\nBefore starting her PhD, Sara previously was appointed by President Barack H. Obama to serve in the U.S. Department of Labor as a Legislative Officer for the Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs (OCIA). In this role, Sara was responsible for communications between the U.S. Department of Labor and the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives. She also designed an award-winning information management system for her agency, resulting in recognition from the U.S. Secretary of Labor. After her time serving in the federal government, Sara worked for Microsoft Corporation where she conducted research on online labor markets, resulting in peer-reviewed articles, and for the Chief Economist, where she helped to deploy Wi-Fi networks around the world.\n\n\nThis page brought to you by Sara Kingsley (2023)"
