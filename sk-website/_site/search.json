    "text": "Sara Kingsley is a PhD Researcher at Carnegie Mellon University’s School of Computer Science, where she is advised by Dr. Beibei Li and Dr. Jeffrey P. Bigham.\nSara is an expert in designing methods to investigate social media platforms and online labor markets for unlawful and discriminatory practices, having researched Facebook, Google, Twitter, and YouTube.\nMore recently, her dissertation work focuses on studying how the design of algorithms and digital platforms impacts how marginalized groups and low-income job seekers find economic opportunities.\nBefore starting her PhD, Sara previously was appointed by President Barack H. Obama to serve in the U.S. Department of Labor as a Legislative Officer for the Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs (OCIA). In this role, Sara was responsible for communications between the U.S. Department of Labor and the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives. She also designed an award-winning information management system for her agency, resulting in recognition from the U.S. Secretary of Labor. After her time serving in the federal government, Sara worked for Microsoft Corporation where she conducted research on online labor markets, resulting in peer-reviewed articles, and for the Chief Economist, where she helped to deploy Wi-Fi networks around the world."

    "text": "Collaborating/Researching Together\nIf you are currently an undergraduate or Master’s student at Carnegie Mellon, please email me if you are interested to participate in a semester or year-long research apprenticeship (e.g. ‘independent study’). In the email, please let me know your top 1-3 research interests, any academic and career goals you’d like to work toward during the research opportunity and any skills you would like to learn (for example, ‘applied machine learning’). Upon receiving your email, if I have openings for the semester, I will schedule a 30 minute meeting to chat and see if our interests align. Following this meeting, I typically encourage students to speak with my past students (upon their availability) and their advisor to best ensure I am a suitable research advisor and to ensure the student is planning to enroll in a sufficient number of credits at the approval of their advisor. Then we typically meet again to decide upon goals for the semester and sign administrative forms. Finally, we schedule our first 1:1 research meeting, which typically entails talking about 4 types of goals: research (for the semester), academics (generally and longer term), applied skills (e.g. ‘python’, ‘ml’, ‘statistics’), and then finally, career goals (ok if these aren’t known!).\nResearch students are fully integrated into our lab’s activities and are considered integral research team members, often coauthoring one or more research publications. However, we aim to make sure there is work-life and research-class balance and that research obligations match credit hours and the student’s needs and other priorities. As well, we welcome and are happy to provide accommodations to students with disabilities, care-taking and employment obligations (including providing remote-only options [our research meetings are all remote at this time]).\nExcited and looking forward to potentially working together! Please don’t hesitate to reach out.\n\nRegretfully, at this time I do not have the capacity to supervise the research of undergraduate students who are not currently CMU students. I am happy to chat more generally about graduate school, PhD programs and research interests though, please don’t hesitate to send an email with questions!"
